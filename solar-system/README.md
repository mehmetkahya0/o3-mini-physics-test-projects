# Solar System Model

This project is a Python simulation of a simple solar system using the turtle graphics library.

## Description
- Displays a stationary Sun.
- Animates Earth and Mars orbiting the Sun in circular paths.
- Uses mathematical calculations to simulate orbits.

This project is made with OpenAI o3-mini (Github Copilot extension)


## How to Run
- Ensure Python 3 is installed with tkinter support.
- Run the simulation via:
  ```
  python solar.py
  ```

## Requirements
- Python 3 with tkinter (for turtle graphics)

## Notes
- Adjust orbit radii and speeds in solar.py for different simulation effects.
