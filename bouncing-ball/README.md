# Hexagon Bounce

Hexagon Bounce is a 3D simulation built using Python, PyGame, and PyOpenGL. It visualizes a ball bouncing inside a rotating hexagonal container with realistic physicsâ€”including gravity, friction, and restitution.

This project is made with OpenAI o3-mini (Github Copilot extension)
